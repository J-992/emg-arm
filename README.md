# EMG-Prosthetic-Arm
Prosthetic arm crit files

- need to fabricate custom pcb
- need to design hand prototype
- need to design finger/hand movement

wet electrode creation

dry electrode creation
https://www.instructables.com/Simple-Dry-Electrode-EMG-for-Arduino/

Code Reqs:
- class to import real time servo data
- class to process servo data (converting to either motor or LEDs)
- (Experimental): using AI to "assume" movements based on historical/logged data

Use cpp to receive and send info to arduino,
use python to process it?



- 3D cad (fingers, palm support, amputee compatibility)



Process:
- initial designs
- Design individual finger, figure out how to make it move
-
