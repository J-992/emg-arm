# EMG-Prosthetic-Arm
<<<<<<< HEAD
Prosthetic arm crit files

- need to fabricate custom pcb DONE
- need to design hand prototype 
- need to design finger/hand actuation mechanism


Code Reqs:
- class to import real time servo data
- class to process servo data (converting to either motor or LEDs)
- (Experimental): using AI to "assume" movements based on historical/logged data

Use cpp to receive and send info to arduino,
use python to process it?



- 3D cad (fingers, palm support, amputee compatibility)



Process:
- initial designs
- Design individual finger, figure out how to make it move
- 
=======
(STILL IN DEVELOPMENT)

loads of delay as chip design took multiple iterations
